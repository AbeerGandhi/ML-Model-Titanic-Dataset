# ML-Model-Titanic-Dataset
To study and apply Data Preprocessing techniques on given dataset.
Prepare a titanic dataset for training with machine learning algorithm by applying suitable data preprocessing techniques.
• Perform basic EDA using functions like head(), tail(), describe(), shape.
• Identify & handle missing value.
• Check for duplicates and handle it.
• Identify outliers & handle it.
• Apply data encoding technique on suitable attribute.
• Apply Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate analysis
• Apply feature scaling technique on suitable attribute.
• Split the dataset in the ratio of 80:20
